emacs-setup: my weird emacs configuration
--------------------

It's a bit unorthodox in a way that it replaces traditional emacs keybindings
like "C-x ..." and "C-c ..." with more mainstream copy-paste ops, same for the
rest of weirdish emacs-only conventions
([obligatory illustration](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5012/5538744965_ff1e6f650d_z.jpg)).

Since I started using emacs as an $EDITOR in 2009 and didn't know about any
modes that make it more mainstream-ish back then (not sure they existed at that
point, and/or merged into mainline), it can be hacky and can probably be done in
an easier and more supported way now, which is just impractical for me to adopt
since I already have what I need here.


COPYING
--------------------

Some elisp code here is merged from other projects and should have respective
license blurb and attribution at the top. Feel free to ping me if it's missing.

PNG icons were taken from various open-source projects and probably are subject
to some licenses as well.

The rest (my code) I don't really care about - WTFPL, Public Domain, Beerware,
GPL (can be coupled with GPL code) or something like that.
